Contains analysis code used in the paper: Halpin SJ, Xing L, Greenwood DC, Tang NKY, Trujillo-Barreto N, Brown C, Jones AKP, O'Connor RJ, Casson AJ, Sivan M, "Pre-sleep alpha brain entrainment by audio or visual stimulation for fibromyalgia and sleep disturbance: A randomised crossover feasibility trial".

Requires Matlab (2023a was used), EEGlab (v2023.1 was used), Python (3.11 was used), and Python FOOOF (from https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/) to be installed and set up appropriately. They are not included in this repository. Instructions on interfacing Matlab and Python are given at https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-python-libraries.html.

The raw EEG data is also not shared here. It can be shared, in-line with the approvals we have in place, via direct contact with the authors (s.j.halpin@leeds.ac.uk, alex.casson@manchester.ac.uk) on reasonable request. 

Analysis starts with the run_analysis.m file, and further functions/files are called from this.
